# Zahir
Zahir is a research project dealing with music and contemporary dance improvisation interrelations. 
It is composed of a wearable device containing a sensor of your choice (standardised for certain adafruit sensors), a QT-PY esp32 C-3 and a lipo for power.
communication between the MCU and the sensor is done via I2C. Communication between the device and the computer is done via BLE (bluetooth low energy). The device sends MIDI messages to your computer. 
*note : the PETG shell is not needed, it just provides protection to the device*
